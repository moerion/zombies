This was my attempt at one of the zappos zcode challenges.

It was supposed to be a web responsive zombie survival guide but I stopped before managing to make it responsive.

I was learning web dev, specifically using NodeJS and decided to give it a try.

It was developed using Express framework and jade for dynamic html design.
